# My Advent of Code Library

## About

This repository contains a small library of functions and classes I use in the various Advent of Code solutions.  I've split it out into its on repository so I can improve the code and add features such as unit testing and code coverage.  It works for the AoC puzzles but is not written for speed or efficiency.
